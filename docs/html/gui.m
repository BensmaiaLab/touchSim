%% TouchSim GUI
% The GUI allows quick and straightforward creation of complex
% |AfferentPopulation| objects through a simple graphical interface.

% After starting the GUI, it presents an empty outline of the hand.

% Single afferents can then be placed manually or at the centers of
% individual sub-parts by clicking the respective buttons. Hand regions can
% also be filled automatically by drawing afferent locations from a
% spatially uniform distribution at the indicated innervation density.
